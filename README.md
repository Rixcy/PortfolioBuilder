# Portfolio - built by Richard Booth ([Rixcy](https://github.com/Rixcy))

### This is a template you can use to build a portfolio with, using Jekyll to create static pages

To start with, ensure you have the pre-requisitites required to use Jekyll, outlined in the [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

To edit the about me section, edit the `about.markdown` file in the `_includes` folder.

To edit the jobs, add/remove the markdown files in the `_jobs` folder, giving them numerical names from the earliest job to the most recent.

To edit any other variables, such as the page title, name, footer text etc, edit the `_config.yml` file.

You can edit the header image by replacing `header.jpg` in `assets/img/`.

To test this locally, you can run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and access the site on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

This project uses [Jekyll Email Protect](https://github.com/vwochnik/jekyll-email-protect) which obfuscates `mailto:` links to protect email addresses from spam bots.
